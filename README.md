__What is CBOR__?  [CBOR](CBOR_GOLANG.md) ([RFC 7049](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049)) is a binary data format inspired by JSON and MessagePack.  CBOR is used in [IETF](https://www.ietf.org) Internet Standards such as COSE ([RFC 8152](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8152)) and CWT ([RFC 8392 CBOR Web Token](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8392)). Even WebAuthn uses CBOR.

__Why this CBOR library?__ It doesn't crash and it has well-balanced qualities: small, fast, safe and easy. It can provide "preferred serialization" by correctly converting floating-point values to float16 (if they fit).

* __Small apps__.  Same programs are 4-9 MB smaller by switching to this library.  No code gen and the only imported pkg is [cbor-go/float16](https://github.com/cbor-go/float16) which is maintained by the same team as this library.

* __Small data__.  The `toarray` and `keyasint` struct tags can shrink size of Go structs encoded to CBOR.  Also, integers always encode to smallest type that fits.  Optionally, floats can shrink from float64 to float32 or float16 when values fit.

* __Fast__. v1.3 became faster than a well-known library that uses `unsafe` optimizations and code gen.  Faster libraries will always exist, but speed is only one factor.  This library doesn't use `unsafe` optimizations or code gen.  

* __Safe__ and reliable. It prevents crashes on malicious CBOR data by using extensive tests, coverage-guided fuzzing, data validation, and avoiding Go's [`unsafe`](https://golang.org/pkg/unsafe/) pkg. Nested levels for CBOR arrays, maps, and tags are limited to 32.

* __Easy__ and saves time.  It has the same API as [Go](https://golang.org)'s [`encoding/json`](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/) when possible.  Existing structs don't require changes.  Go struct tags like `` `cbor:"name,omitempty"` `` and `` `json:"name,omitempty"` `` work as expected.

New struct tags like __`keyasint`__ and __`toarray`__ make compact CBOR data like COSE, CWT, and SenML easier to use.

## Comparisons

Comparisons are between this newer library and a well-known library that had 1,000+ stars before this library was created.  Default build settings for each library were used for all comparisons.

__This library is safer__.  Small malicious CBOR messages are rejected quickly before they exhaust system resources.

![alt text](https://github.com/fxamacker/images/raw/master/cbor/v1.4.0/cbor_safety_comparison.png "CBOR library safety comparison")

__This library is smaller__. Programs like senmlCat can be 4 MB smaller by switching to this library.  Programs using more complex CBOR data types can be 9.2 MB smaller.

![alt text](https://github.com/fxamacker/images/raw/master/cbor/v1.4.0/cbor_size_comparison.png "CBOR library and program size comparison chart")

__This library is faster__ for encoding and decoding CBOR Web Token (CWT).  However, speed is only one factor and it can vary depending on data types and sizes.  Unlike the other library, this one doesn't use Go's ```unsafe``` package or code gen.

![alt text](https://github.com/fxamacker/images/raw/master/cbor/v1.4.0/cbor_speed_comparison.png "CBOR library speed comparison chart")

The resource intensive `codec.CborHandle` initialization (in the other library) was placed outside the benchmark loop to make sure their library wasn't penalized.

Doing your own comparisons is highly recommended.  Use your most common message sizes and data types.

## Current Status
Version 1.x has:

* __Stable API__ – won't make breaking API changes.  
* __Stable requirements__ – will always support Go v1.12 (unless there's compelling reason).
* __Passed fuzzing__ – v1.4 passed 532+ million execs in coverage-guided fuzzing at the time of release. And v1.4 will continue fuzzing until it reaches 1+ billion execs (or until a newer release needs fuzzing.)

Each commit passes 375+ tests. Each release also passes 250+ million execs in coverage-guided fuzzing using 1,000+ CBOR files (corpus). See [Fuzzing and Code Coverage](#fuzzing-and-code-coverage).

Recent activity:

* [x] [Release v1.3](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor/releases) -- Faster encoding and decoding.
* [x] [Release v1.3](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor/releases) -- Add `toarray` struct tag to simplify using CBOR arrays.
* [x] [Release v1.3](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor/releases) -- Add `keyasint` struct tag to simplify using CBOR maps with int keys.
* [x] [Release v1.3.4](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor/releases) -- Bugfixes and refactoring.  Limit nested levels to 32 for arrays, maps, tags.
* [x] [Release v1.4](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor/releases) -- Deprecate bool encoding options and add int SortMode.  Use float16 to float32 conversion func that had all 65536 results verified to be correct. Fix decoding of float16 subnormal numbers.
* [x] unreleased -- Add option to shrink floating-point values to smaller sizes like float16 (if they preserve value).
* [x] unreleased -- Add options for encoding floating-point NaN values: NaNConvertNone, NanConvert7e00, NanConvertQuiet, or NaNConvertPreserveSignal.

Coming soon: support for CBOR tags (major type 6). After that, options for handling duplicate map keys.

## Design Goals 
This library is designed to be a generic CBOR encoder and decoder.  It was initially created for a [WebAuthn (FIDO2) server library](https://github.com/fxamacker/webauthn), because existing CBOR libraries (in Go) didn't meet certain criteria in 2019.

This library is designed to be:

* __Easy__ – API is like `encoding/json` plus `keyasint` and `toarray` struct tags.
* __Small__ – Programs in cisco/senml are 4 MB smaller by switching to this library. In extreme cases programs can be smaller by 9+ MB. No code gen and the only imported pkg is [cbor-go/float16](https://github.com/cbor-go/float16) which is maintained by the same team.
* __Safe and reliable__ – No `unsafe` pkg, coverage >95%, coverage-guided fuzzing, and data validation to avoid crashes on malformed or malicious data.

Competing factors are balanced:

* __Speed__ vs __safety__ vs __size__ – to keep size small, avoid code generation. For safety, validate data and avoid Go's `unsafe` pkg.  For speed, use safe optimizations such as caching struct metadata. v1.4 is faster than a well-known library that uses `unsafe` and code gen.
* __Standards compliance__ – CBOR ([RFC 7049](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049)) with minor [limitations](#limitations).  Encoder supports options for sorting, floating-point conversions, and more.  Predefined configurations are also available so you can use "CTAP2 Canonical CBOR", etc. without knowing individual options.  Decoder checks for well-formedness, validates data, and limits nested levels to defend against attacks.  See [Standards](#standards).

All releases prioritize reliability to avoid crashes on decoding malformed CBOR data. See [Fuzzing and Coverage](#fuzzing-and-code-coverage).

Features not in Go's standard library are usually not added.  However, the __`toarray`__ struct tag in ugorji/go was too useful to ignore. It was added in v1.3 when a project mentioned they were using it with CBOR to save disk space.

## Features

* API is like `encoding/json` plus extra struct tags:
  * `cbor.Encoder` writes CBOR to `io.Writer`.  
  * `cbor.Decoder` reads CBOR from `io.Reader`.
  * `cbor.Marshal` writes CBOR to `[]byte`.  
  * `cbor.Unmarshal` reads CBOR from `[]byte`.  
* Support "cbor" and "json" keys in Go's struct tags. If both are specified, then "cbor" is used.
* `toarray` struct tag allows named struct fields for elements of CBOR arrays.
* `keyasint` struct tag allows named struct fields for elements of CBOR maps with int keys.
* Encoder has easy functions that create and return modifiable configurations:
  * func CanonicalEncOptions() EncOptions
  * func CTAP2EncOptions() EncOptions
  * func CoreDetEncOptions() EncOptions
  * func PreferredUnsortedEncOptions() EncOptions
* For Go integers, encoder always uses "preferred serialization" which encodes their values to the smallest number of bytes.
* Encoder floating-point option types: ShortestFloatMode, InfConvertMode, and NaNConvertMode.
  * ShortestFloatMode: ShortestFloatNone or ShortestFloat16 (IEEE 754 binary16, etc. if value fits).
  * InfConvertMode: InfConvertNone or InfConvertFloat16.
  * NanConvertMode: NaNConvertNone, NanConvert7e00, NanConvertQuiet, or NaNConvertPreserveSignal
* Encoder sort options: SortNone, SortBytewiseLexical, SortCanonical, SortCTAP2, SortCoreDeterministic  
* Support `encoding.BinaryMarshaler` and `encoding.BinaryUnmarshaler` interfaces.
* Support `cbor.RawMessage` which can delay CBOR decoding or precompute CBOR encoding.
* Support `cbor.Marshaler` and `cbor.Unmarshaler` interfaces to allow user-defined types to have custom CBOR encoding and decoding.
* Support `time.Time` as RFC 3339 formatted text string or Unix time.
* Support indefinite length CBOR data (["streaming"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049#section-2.2)).  For decoding, each indefinite length "container" must fit into memory to perform well-formedness checks that prevent exploits. Go's `io.LimitReader` can be used to limit sizes.
* Encoder uses struct field visibility rules for anonymous struct fields (same rules as `encoding/json`.)
* Encoder always uses smallest CBOR integer sizes for more compact data serialization.
* Decoder always checks for invalid UTF-8 string errors.
* Decoder always decodes in-place to slices, maps, and structs.
* Decoder uses case-insensitive field name match when decoding to structs. 
* Both encoder and decoder correctly handles nil slice, map, pointer, and interface values.

Coming soon: support for CBOR tags (major type 6).  After that, options for handling duplicate map keys.

## Standards
This library implements CBOR as specified in [RFC 7049](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049) with minor [limitations](#limitations).

For Go integers, encoder always uses "preferred serialization" which encodes their values to the smallest number of bytes.

Encoder has options that can be set individually to create custom configurations. Easy functions are also provided to create and return modifiable configurations (EncOptions):

* CanonicalEncOptions() -- [Canonical CBOR (RFC 7049)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049#section-3.9).
* CTAP2EncOptions() -- [CTAP2 Canonical CBOR](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.0-id-20180227/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.0-id-20180227.html#ctap2-canonical-cbor-encoding-form).
* CoreDetEncOptions() -- Core Deterministic Encoding (floats use [IEEE 754 binary16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-precision_floating-point_format) if value is preserved).
* PreferredUnsortedEncOptions() -- Preferred Serialization (unsorted, shortest integer and floating-point forms that preserve values, NaN values encoded as 0xf97e00).

__Encoder's SortMode__ has 3 options (and 3 aliases):

* SortNone: no sorting.
* SortLengthFirst: length-first map key ordering.
* SortBytewiseLexical: bytewise lexicographic ordering.
* SortCanonical [(RFC 7049 Section 3.9)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049#section-3.9): same as SortLengthFirst.
* SortCTAP2Canonical [(CTAP2 Canonical CBOR)](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.0-id-20180227/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.0-id-20180227.html#ctap2-canonical-cbor-encoding-form): same as SortBytewiseLexical.
* SortCoreDeterministic: same as SortBytewiseLexical.

Encoder has 3 types of options for floating-point data: ShortestFloatMode, InfConvertMode, and NaNConvertMode.

__Encoder's ShortestFloatMode__ can be:

* ShortestFloatNone: no conversion.
* ShortestFloat16: uses float16 ([IEEE 754 binary16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-precision_floating-point_format)) as the shortest form that preserves value.

With ShortestFloat16, each encoded float can be float64, float32 or float16 -- whichever is the smallest size that preserves original value.

__Encoder's InfConvertMode__ overrides ShortestFloatMode for infinity values and can be:

* InfConvertNone: don't convert +- infinity to other representations -- used by CTAP2 Canonical CBOR
* InfConvertFloat16: convert +- infinity to float16 since they always preserve value (recommended)

__Encoder's NaNConvertMode__ overrides ShortestFloatMode for NaN values and can be:

* NaNConvertNone: don't convert NaN to other representations -- used by CTAP2 Canonical CBOR.
* NaNConvert7e00: encode to 0xf97e00 (CBOR float16 = 0x7e00) -- used by RFC 7049 Canonical CBOR.
* NaNConvertQuiet: force quiet bit = 1 and use shortest form that preserves NaN payload.
* NaNConvertPreserveSignal: convert to smallest form that preserves value (quit bit unmodified and NaN payload preserved) -- described in RFC 7049bis Draft 12 when protocols don't want predifined value such as 0x7e00.

Float16 conversions use [cbor-go/float16](https://github.com/cbor-go/float16) maintained by the same team as this library.  All 4+ billion possible conversions are verified to be correct in that library.

Decoder checks for all required well-formedness errors described in the latest RFC 7049bis, including all "subkinds" of syntax errors and too little data.

After well-formedness is verified, basic validity errors are handled as follows:

* Invalid UTF-8 string: Decoder always checks and returns invalid UTF-8 string error.
* Duplicate keys in a map: By default, decoder decodes to a map with duplicate keys by overwriting previous value with the same key.  Options to handle duplicate map keys in different ways may be added as a feature.

When decoding well-formed CBOR arrays and maps, decoder saves the first error it encounters and continues with the next item.  Options to handle this differently may be added in the future.

## Limitations
CBOR tags (type 6) is being added in the next release ([milestone v2.0](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor/milestone/3)) and is coming soon.

Known limitations:

* Currently, CBOR tag numbers are ignored.  Decoder simply decodes tag content. Work is in progress to add support.
* Currently, duplicate map keys are not checked during decoding.  Option to handle duplicate map keys in different ways will be added.
* Nested levels for CBOR arrays, maps, and tags are limited to 32 to quickly reject potentially malicious data.  This limit will be reconsidered upon request.
* CBOR negative int (type 1) that cannot fit into Go's int64 are not supported, such as RFC 7049 example -18446744073709551616.  Decoding these values returns `cbor.UnmarshalTypeError` like Go's `encoding/json`.
* CBOR `Undefined` (0xf7) value decodes to Go's `nil` value.  Use CBOR `Null` (0xf6) to round-trip with Go's `nil`.

Like Go's `encoding/json`, data validation checks the entire message to prevent partially filled (corrupted) data. This library also prevents crashes and resource exhaustion attacks from malicious CBOR data. Use Go's `io.LimitReader` when decoding very large data to limit size.

## Fuzzing and Code Coverage

__Over 375 tests__ must pass before tagging a release.  They include all RFC 7049 examples, bugs found by fuzzing, 2 maliciously crafted CBOR data, and over 87 tests with malformed data based on RFC 7049bis.

__Code coverage__ must not fall below 95% when tagging a release.  Code coverage is 97.8% (`go test -cover`) for cbor v1.4 which is among the highest for libraries (in Go) of this type.

__Coverage-guided fuzzing__ must pass 250+ million execs before tagging a release.  E.g. v1.3.2 was tagged when it reached 364.9 million execs and continued fuzzing (4+ billion execs) with [fxamacker/cbor-fuzz](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor-fuzz).  Default corpus has:

* 2 files related to WebAuthn (FIDO U2F key).
* 3 files with custom struct.
* 9 files with [CWT examples (RFC 8392 Appendix A)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8392#appendix-A)
* 17 files with [COSE examples (RFC 8152 Appendix B & C)](https://github.com/cose-wg/Examples/tree/master/RFC8152).
* 81 files with [CBOR examples (RFC 7049 Appendix A) ](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049#appendix-A). It excludes 1 errata first reported in [issue #46](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor/issues/46).

Over 1,000 files (corpus) are used for fuzzing because it includes fuzz-generated corpus.

## System Requirements

* Go 1.12 (or newer)
* Tested and fuzzed on linux_amd64, but it should work on other platforms.

## Versions and API Changes
This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org), so the API is always backwards compatible unless the major version number changes.

## API 
The API is the same as `encoding/json` when possible.

In addition to the API, the `keyasint` and `toarray` struct tags are worth knowing.  They can reduce programming effort, improve system performance, and reduce the size of serialized data.  

```
package cbor // import "github.com/fxamacker/cbor"

func Marshal(v interface{}, encOpts EncOptions) ([]byte, error)
func Unmarshal(data []byte, v interface{}) error
func Valid(data []byte) (rest []byte, err error)

    func NewDecoder(r io.Reader) *Decoder
    func (dec *Decoder) Decode(v interface{}) (err error)
    func (dec *Decoder) NumBytesRead() int

type UnsupportedTypeError struct{ ... }
```
See [API docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/fxamacker/cbor) for more details.

## Installation
```
go get github.com/fxamacker/cbor
```
[Released versions](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor/releases) benefit from longer fuzz tests.

## Usage
👉 Use Go's `io.LimitReader` when decoding very large data to limit size.

The API is the same as `encoding/json` when possible:

* cbor.Marshal writes CBOR to []byte
* cbor.Unmarshal reads CBOR from []byte
* cbor.Encoder writes CBOR to io.Writer
* cbor.Decoder reads CBOR from io.Reader

The `keyasint` and `toarray` struct tags make it easy to use compact CBOR message formats.  Internet standards often use CBOR arrays and CBOR maps with int keys to save space.

Using named struct fields instead of array elements or maps with int keys makes code more readable and less error prone.

__Decoding CWT (CBOR Web Token)__ using `keyasint` and `toarray` struct tags:
```
// Signed CWT is defined in RFC 8392
type signedCWT struct {
	_           struct{} `cbor:",toarray"`
	Protected   []byte
	Unprotected coseHeader
	Payload     []byte
	Signature   []byte
}

// Part of COSE header definition
type coseHeader struct {
	Alg int    `cbor:"1,keyasint,omitempty"`
	Kid []byte `cbor:"4,keyasint,omitempty"`
	IV  []byte `cbor:"5,keyasint,omitempty"`
}

// data is []byte containing signed CWT

var v signedCWT
if err := cbor.Unmarshal(data, &v); err != nil {
	return err
}
```

__Encoding CWT (CBOR Web Token)__ using `keyasint` and `toarray` struct tags:
```
// Use signedCWT struct defined in "Decoding CWT" example.

var v signedCWT
...
if data, err := cbor.Marshal(v, cbor.EncOptions{}); err != nil {
	return err
}
```

__Decoding SenML__ using `keyasint` struct tag:
```
// RFC 8428 says, "The data is structured as a single array that 
// contains a series of SenML Records that can each contain fields"

type SenMLRecord struct {
	BaseName    string  `cbor:"-2,keyasint,omitempty"`
	BaseTime    float64 `cbor:"-3,keyasint,omitempty"`
	BaseUnit    string  `cbor:"-4,keyasint,omitempty"`
	BaseValue   float64 `cbor:"-5,keyasint,omitempty"`
	BaseSum     float64 `cbor:"-6,keyasint,omitempty"`
	BaseVersion int     `cbor:"-1,keyasint,omitempty"`
	Name        string  `cbor:"0,keyasint,omitempty"`
	Unit        string  `cbor:"1,keyasint,omitempty"`
	Value       float64 `cbor:"2,keyasint,omitempty"`
	ValueS      string  `cbor:"3,keyasint,omitempty"`
	ValueB      bool    `cbor:"4,keyasint,omitempty"`
	ValueD      string  `cbor:"8,keyasint,omitempty"`
	Sum         float64 `cbor:"5,keyasint,omitempty"`
	Time        float64 `cbor:"6,keyasint,omitempty"`
	UpdateTime  float64 `cbor:"7,keyasint,omitempty"`
}

// data is a []byte containing SenML

var v []SenMLRecord
if err := cbor.Unmarshal(data, &v); err != nil {
	return err
}
```

__Encoding SenML__ using `keyasint` struct tag and `ShortestFloat16` encoding option:
```
// use SenMLRecord struct defined in "Decoding SenML" example

var v []SenMLRecord
...
if data, err := cbor.Marshal(v, cbor.EncOptions{ShortestFloat: cbor.ShortestFloat16}); err != nil {
	return err
}
```

__Decoding__:

```
// create a decoder
dec := cbor.NewDecoder(reader)

// decode into empty interface
var i interface{}
err = dec.Decode(&i)

// decode into struct 
var stru ExampleStruct
err = dec.Decode(&stru)

// decode into map
var m map[string]string
err = dec.Decode(&m)

// decode into primitive
var f float32
err = dec.Decode(&f)
```

__Encoding__:

```
// create an encoder with canonical CBOR encoding enabled
enc := cbor.NewEncoder(writer, cbor.CanonicalEncOptions())

// encode struct
err = enc.Encode(stru)

// encode map
err = enc.Encode(m)

// encode primitive
err = enc.Encode(f)
```

__Encoding indefinite length array__:

```
enc := cbor.NewEncoder(writer, cbor.EncOptions{})

// start indefinite length array encoding
err = enc.StartIndefiniteArray()

// encode array element
err = enc.Encode(1)

// encode array element
err = enc.Encode([]int{2, 3})

// start nested indefinite length array as array element
err = enc.StartIndefiniteArray()

// encode nested array element
err = enc.Encode(4)

// encode nested array element
err = enc.Encode(5)

// end nested indefinite length array
err = enc.EndIndefinite()

// end indefinite length array
err = enc.EndIndefinite()
```

## Benchmarks

Go structs are faster than maps with string keys:

* decoding into struct is >31% faster than decoding into map.
* encoding struct is >33% faster than encoding map.

Go structs with `keyasint` struct tag are faster than maps with integer keys:

* decoding into struct is >25% faster than decoding into map.
* encoding struct is >31% faster than encoding map.

Go structs with `toarray` struct tag are faster than slice:

* decoding into struct is >15% faster than decoding into slice.
* encoding struct is >10% faster than encoding slice.

Doing your own benchmarks is highly recommended.  Use your most common message sizes and data types.
