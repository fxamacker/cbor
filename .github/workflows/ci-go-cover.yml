# CI Go Cover 2023.5.14.
# This GitHub Actions workflow checks if Go (Golang) code coverage satisfies the required minimum.
# The required minimum is specified in the workflow name to keep badge.svg and verified minimum in sync.
#
# To help protect your privacy, this workflow avoids external services.
# This workflow simply runs `go test -short -cover` --> grep --> python.
# The python script is embedded and readable in this file.
# 
# Steps to install and set minimum required coverage:
# 0. Copy this file to github.com/OWNER_NAME/REPO_NAME/.github/workflows/ci-go-cover.yml
# 1. Change workflow name from "cover 100%" to "cover ≥92.5%". Script will automatically use 92.5%.  
# 2. Update README.md to use the new path to badge.svg because the path includes the workflow name.

  # Verify minimum coverage is reached using `go test -short -cover` on latest-ubuntu with default version of Go.
  # The grep expression can't be too strict, it needed to be relaxed to work with different versions of Go.
